# Duck_Hunt
Duck hunt developed with Tiva-c series tm124c123gxl by https://github.com/dua19022(dua19022) and pu19249(https://github.com/pu19249)

Using the ILI9341 TFT display shield with 8b communication with the TIVA-C, we re-created the classic game Duck Hunt (https://www.nintendo.es/Juegos/NES/Duck-Hunt-946955.html) using an Arduino Leonardo and another Tiva-c of the same type as controllers for two players in exchangable player turn in the main menu of the game. Along with a Passive Buzzer to add the classic tones of the Duck Hunt.
