# Duck_Hunt
 Duck hunt developed with Tiva-c series tm124c123gxl
 
 Using the ILI9341 TFT display shield with 8b communication with the TIVA-C, we re-created the classic game Duck Hunt (https://www.nintendo.es/Juegos/NES/Duck-Hunt-946955.html)
 using two .. as controllers for two players in exchangable player turn in the main menu of the game. Along with a Passive Buzzer to add the classic tones of the Duck Hunt.
